# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to look at the Data of UFO Sightings by being able to filter multiple criteria. We can filter by city, state, country, shape and datetime. 

Users are able to look at data based on specific filters based on their analysis requirements. The webpage provides a very friendly UI. 

## Results
Someone can use this webpage by filtering by specific information as per their needs. For example, if they want to do an analysis on California only, they would put 'ca' in the state filter. The data would only show California data. Using this they can perform their analysis. 

Another scenario is if they wanted to look at a specific date. For example, if the user believes UFOs are most often seen on January 1st they put that date in and see the data and peform their analysis.

This allows users to perform a more detailed and accurate analysis allowing them to look at specific criteria to come to an accurate solution. 

## Summary
One drawback is that the filters require input that is extremely specific. One recommendation I have is to allow users to put a date range. This would allow users to compare months or years. Another recommendation is to allow users to make multiple selections for city, state, country and shape.
